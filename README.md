# Linaro-Website-full

## Introduction

This is a _test_ repo, not intended for general use!

## Prerequisites

* Git client
* Outgoing HTTPS (for `git pull`)
* Outgoing SSH (for `git push`)

## Submodules

Source code for:

* [Linaro website](https://www.linaro.org/)
* Dockerised Jekyll build
* Link checker
* Jekyll theme
* Wiki documentation for the above, when available.

_Note:_ the submodules are configured to track matching branches when possible. If that is not possible, the latest known good `tag` is used. If that is not possible, the `master` branch (tracking `HEAD`) is used.
